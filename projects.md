So this is the page where I shove my projects down your throat because I'm so proud of them.

Really, I'm pretty fond of them, not because I think they're particularly good, but because they're my creations.

My little Frankenstein monsters, so to speak.

This is [Hom](http://homm.herkouapp.com), my final project from Lighthouse Labs.
[Steph](http://github.com/stephchuolee), [Sumit](http://github.com/sumitsekhri), [Ryan](http://github.com/kludgemaster) and I worked on it for approx 2 weeks.

This is [Pamoja](http://pamoja.herokuapp.com), my midterm project from the same bootcamp.
[Rahim](http://github.com/rahimjad), [Sam](http://github.com/sammy-d), and I worked on this baby for about a week or so.
