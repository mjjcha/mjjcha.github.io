So this is the page where I shove my projects down your throat because I'm so proud of them.

Really, I'm pretty fond of them, not because I think they're particularly good, but because they're my creations.

My little Frankenstein monsters, so to speak.

This is [Hom] {{homm.herkouapp.com}}, my final project from Lighthouse Labs.
[Steph] ({github.com/stephchuolee}), [Sumit] ({github.com/sumitsekhri}), [Ryan] ({github.com/kludgemaster}) and I worked on it for approx 2 weeks. 

This is [Pamoja] ({pamoja.herokuapp.com}), my midterm project from the same bootcamp.
[Rahim] ({github.com/rahimjad}), [Sam] ({github.com/sammy-d}), and I worked on this baby for about a week or so.
