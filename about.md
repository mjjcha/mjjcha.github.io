#Hey,

  I'm Judy. If you're visting this page, I assume it's through github. If not, you're scaring me, get outta here.

  I'll build this page to include more things about projects I've completed and am currently working on, but for now, I'm using it as my sandbox so I can familiarize myself with jekyll. I mean, this markdown language based template is already kinda freaking me out. 

 Anywho, enjoy your stay.


 Judy
